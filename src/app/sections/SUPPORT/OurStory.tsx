                Along the Thai-Myanmar border, thousands of young migrants face
                a critical barrier:
                <strong className="text-white">
                  {" "}
                  lack of access to digital skills education
                </strong>
                . Without these skills, they're locked out of the modern
                economy.
              </p>

              <p>
                Traditional education systems often fail migrant communities.
                Language barriers, high costs, and lack of tailored support
                leave talented youth behind. We saw this problem and decided to
                solve it ourselves.
